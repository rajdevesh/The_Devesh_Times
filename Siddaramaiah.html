<p>How can COVID-19 be cited as reason to explain projects being starved of funds, stopping of welfare schemes, asks former CM<br/>
The BJP government is “using” the COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse to explain all stalled works and dysfunctional administration, charged Leader of the Opposition and former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah.</p>

<p>Speaking on the motion of thanks to the Governor for his address to the joint session of the legislature on Wednesday, he said: “The total compensation paid for those hit by pandemic was no more than ₹2,100 crore. Estimated expenditure for 2020-21 in the budget was ₹2,37,893 crore. We have borrowed ₹63,000 crore this year alone. The government has also claimed in the Governor’s address that tax collection has picked up.”</p>

<p>He sought to know how then the pandemic could be cited as the reason to explain projects being starved of funds, non-payment of dues, and stopping of social welfare schemes such as pensions and student scholarships. Mr. Siddaramaiah reeled out several promises made in the BJP manifesto before polls to say that “non of them” had been fulfilled. He also sought to know why, amidst such crisis due to the pandemic and floods, the government had gone ahead with “anti-farmer” Ordinances, pushing them into greater misery.</p>
