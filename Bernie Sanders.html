<p>Bundled-up Senator spawns 1st viral meme of the Biden era
Standing out in a crowd of glamorously dressed guests, Bernie Sanders showed up for the U..S presidential inauguration in a heavy winter jacket and patterned mittens — with an AFP photo of the veteran leftist spawning the first viral meme of the Biden era.</p>

<p>Social media users quickly pounced on AFP photographer Brendan Smialowski’s shot of a bundled-up Sanders sitting cross-legged, superimposing it on a wide variety of images.</p>

<p>One placed Mr. Sanders on a bench next to Tom Hanks in “Forrest Gump”, another put him in detention with the teenagers from The Breakfast Club, and he also made it into numerous Star Wars scenes.</p>

<p>Some photoshopped him on to the covers of albums by music stars such as Taylor Swift, Kendrick Lamar and Oasis.</p>

<p>“You know, in Vermont... we know something about the cold. We’re not so concerned about good fashion, we want to keep warm. And that’s what I did today,” Mr. Sanders said with a snicker on CBS News after the inauguration.</p>
